## Introduction

Accessible color palette is a tool for easily generating color palettes based on accessibility standards. You can, not only create a color scheme for a website but also check the contrast of your color design for accessibility based on Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG).

## Use it

## How it works

The tool is using the [Colourlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/) API to generate palettes based on a color and then calculates the contrast ratio between the background color and the rest of the colors.
